								<h2>Who I am from a Professional Perspective</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/t1.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>How my Master's degree has helped: My degree in Engineering Management has helped me acquire skills in Database Management and Design, Financial Management, Project Management and Project Management software applications such as MS Project, MS Visio and MS Excel as well as database languages and tools including SQL Server, MongoDB, MySQL and Toad Data Modeler.</p> 
<p>Co-op Experience: I was employed at <a href="https://dental.tufts.edu/" target="_blank">Tufts University School of Dental Medicine</a> as a Business Analyst. Over the course of my 6-month co-op, I was in-charge of generating reports daily using SAP Crystal Reports as well as creating dashboards on Tableau based on key metrics I had helped in identifying. I also worked with the Community Service department and the Patient Experience Department to setup applications and databases for them using MS Access.</p> 
<p>Work Experience prior to Master's degree: I was employed at Tata Consultancy Services where I worked as a Quality Assurance Analyst.  My primary role involved direct interaction with the client to negotiate requirements and communicate them to the engineering team. My interpersonal and communication skills were acknowledged as one of my strong suits due to which I was the intermediary between the company and the client for the International Trade Finance module. TCS
helped me develop my documentation skills (e.g. user manual creation and test case documentation) as it was a big part of my work week. I also had to perform field level testing as well as back-end testing using SQL. </p>
<p> Business Development Experience: I was a business development associate at The Iota Club as well as at AIESEC Boston. Business Devlopment has provided me with important skills such as being able to Conduct Market Research in order to target prospective clients; forming new as well as strengthing existing client relationships; Improving my communication skills; Developing my Negotiation and Strategic skills, and simultaneously equipping me with Project Management skills as we view our business as a project in itself.
